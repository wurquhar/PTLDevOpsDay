All of these things are Information Radiators - they display information in real time and publicly. 

ðŸ¥¶ Don't be an Information Refrigerator ðŸ§Š

### Information Radiators
#### _An Information Radiator..._
- Visually represents and radiates all aspects of work.
- Typically, information useful to team members, stakeholders, and users is physically presented on walls, windows, doors, and other flat surfaces. Position the information in the line of sight of those people who get value from consuming it.
- Enables someone interested in the work to "Walk the Walls," meaning they can walk around the physical space where associated teams are working and get all the information they need by inspecting artifacts on the walls and from the resulting conversations.



### Information Radiators
#### _Why visualize work?_
- Facilitates a transparent and open way of working.
- Avoids hiding information about status, progress, direction, challenges, and opportunities related to a project.
- When important information is constantly accessible and visible to team members, both the speed and accuracy of their work can improve. Waste is reduced because the team spends less time searching for information.
- It is more likely that the information is accurate because people are continuously reminded of it.

### Target Outcomes



#### What are your expectations for the next few days?

* Everyone grab a pen and a few sticky notes.
* Individually write your expectations (one per sticky note).
* Add them to a class board named "Expectations."
* Group the sticky notes by affinity.
* Discuss expectations by comparing them to the course's Target Outcomes.



#### _What are Target Outcomes?_
- A tool to capture and articulate the goals and outcomes that a team is striving to deliver
- Can include customer (end user) based outcomes as well as business and capability based outcomes
- Harnesses and summarizes the findings and learnings from other Discovery practices into a finite set of statements that can be publicly displayed for team and stakeholders to regularly reference
