#### _What is it?_
When you hear someone say that they are doing Agile, their team is using Agile, or their organization has adopted Agile, there's a very strong chance that what they are actually doing is some form of Scrum. <!--{.element: style="font-size: smaller; font-weight: 100;"} -->
</br></br>

##### Scrum is not the same as agile. 
Agile is an ideology. It is underpinned by those values and principles set out in the Agile Manifesto. Scrum is one of several frameworks that embodies Agile and makes the principles a reality through a group of practices. It is also, by far, the most popular Agile framework. <!--{.element: style="font-size: smaller; font-weight: 100;"} -->

### Origins of Scrum
![Scrum](images/scrum/scrum.jpg) <!-- {.element: class="inline-image"} -->
* A Rugby term used to restart play
* In 1986, Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka published [The New New Product Development Game](https://hbr.org/1986/01/the-new-new-product-development-game).
* In 1990, Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber used Scrum for software development.

#### _Why use it?_
Because of the simplicity of Scrum!
</br>

Often, people confuse the many (now hundreds) of practices associated with Agile as being Scrum. In fact, Scrum has very few practices. We tend to describe them as the 3-5-3 of Scrum (which sounds a bit like a formation for a sports team). <!--{.element: style="font-size: smaller; font-weight: 100;"} -->



### The 3-5-3 Formation 
_The 3-5-3 formation represents 3 roles, 5 events (previously known as ceremonies), and 3 artifacts._



#### 3 Key Roles in Scrum
* **Product Owner** - Conveys the message of the envisioned product and sets priorities for team
* **Scrum Master** - Coaches the team on Scrum the process and helps iterate towards a productive environment
* **Development Team Members** - Self-organize to transform backlog items into a potentially releasable product increment



#### 5 Events in Scrum
| Scrum Event | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Sprint Planning** | Commit to a set of defined work as a team for the upcoming sprint cycle. The end result is the Sprint Backlog. |
| **Daily Standup** | Daily sync to share common understanding of the goals, coordinate the team effort, report on progress of work, and communicate problems and improvements. |
| **Sprint Review** | Review what was completed during the sprint with all relevant stakeholders to collect feedback. |
| **Sprint Retrospective** | Help teams reflect on their internal team process with the goal to continuously improve. |
| **Sprint** | A time-boxed event that moves the team towards the goal set for that iteration and ends with reviewing the product increment. |



#### 3 Key Artifacts in Scrum
* **Product Backlog** - Set of all baseline requirements prioritized for the team
* **Sprint Backlog** - Subset of the Product Backlog that the team agreed to pull into the Sprint to work on
* **Product Increment** - The most important artifact that is produced at the end of each Sprint

### Exercise - The Ball Game (Setup)

#### In your groups
![sprint](images/scrum/estimate-actual.png)<!-- .element: class="inline-image" -->
1. Draw a table with two columns and three rows.
2. Record your estimate for an iteration.
3. Pass the balls for one minute.
4. Record the actual score.
5. Reflect on your group strategy.



### Exercise - The Ball Game 
#### Rules
1. Pass as many ping pong balls through all the team members.
2. There must be "air time" between each pass.
3. You cannot use any artificial containers.
</br></br>
#### Layout
We'll have 3 rounds of 1 minute each. There will be 1 minute between each round where you can debrief on strategy, revise methods, and set the forecast for the next round.
