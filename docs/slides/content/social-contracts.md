The Social Contract is a simple, yet highly effective manner to enable team autonomy and self accountability for engagements.<!--{.element: style="font-size: ; font-weight: 400!important;"} -->

A Social Contract codifies behavior and expectations for the team members.<!--{.element: style="font-size: ; font-weight: 400!important;"} -->



#### Effective Social Contracts Are
- Publicly displayed
- Revisited regularly and amended if required
- Binding on *all* parties
- Signatories hold each other accountable



#### _Why use it?_
* Provides a quick means to determine team dynamics and expectations
* Promotes autonomy and self-governing of team behavior
* Keeps the team consciously aware of how they work together
* Establishes empathy and context for future conversations between team members
* Enables psychological safety within the group



#### _How do we do it?_
1) Individually, write down your expectations about working together.
    * Think about behaviors exhibited by really great teams that you've worked with.
    * Consider the behaviors of any terrible teams that you've worked with.
3) Together, review and group the behaviors.
5) After reaching consensus, sign the contract.
6) Display the contract in a visible place.
<br/>

If you work on multiple teams, think about the aspects of your Social Contract that are appropriate for the entire group so you can write the group social contract.<!--{.element: style="font-size: medium; font-weight: 600!important;"} -->



#### _Exercise - Social Contract and Team Identity_

<div class="container">
<div class="col" data-markdown>
</br></br>

1. In table groups, work together to:
    - Discuss how you want to work together this week
    - Write your Social Contract
</br></br>
2. Think about any aspects of your Social Contract that are appropriate for the entire team so that we can write the team Social Contract for how we'll spend the next few days.

#### Facilitation Tips
Ensure that things in the Social Contract are actionable. For example  "Be Open" has good intent, but lacks specificity. Ask questions to tease our greater meanings.
</br>

_"Can you give me an example of not being open?" can lead to actionable items like "Listen to others as I would like to be heard" or "Give space to the quiet person"._ <!--{.element: style="font-size: ; font-weight: 300!important;"} -->
